# Hello

My name is Tim Sloan, my pronouns are he and him, and I am a product strategy consultant and Fractional CTO--I help people build digital products.

You can find me at [Ask For 10](https://www.askfor10.com/).

I build useful software, structure and manage successful teams, and help others do the same.

In the past, I've worked at [Paper Leaf | ZGM](https://paper-leaf.com) and [Lift Interactive](https://liftinteractive.com).

When I write code, I use Python and Django. My second choice is PHP and Laravel.
